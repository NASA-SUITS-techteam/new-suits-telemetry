New code to be generated for heroku

This is the current code that is used to run the Heroku for suits0-ppp

In order to access this code and have it run on Heroku I must give you access to this repository. But it is also easier to just copy and paste as your own in order to skip all of this nonsense. If you try to deploy the code on Heroku without me giving you access it will not allow it. But if you copy and paste it onto your own repository and deploy, it will work. So you just skip the extra steps.
